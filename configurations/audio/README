# Audio Configurations for LibMedia and Stagefright #

When using StageFright and LibMedia for audio playback, configuration is set
in the device configuration of your Android build tree for the device.

These example configurations will switch the device mixer settings to either
point to the speaker port or headphones (line out).

* audio_policy.conf.dbheadphones - Use Drabonboard line out.
* audio_policy.conf.dbspeaker - Use Dragonboard speaker.


## Setting the configuration ##

To change the audio configuration on Dragonboard reference hardware, copy
the file to your Android build tree as:
  device/qcom/dragonboard/base_product/audio_policy.conf

For example to set the audio configuration to headphones:
    cp audio_policy.conf.headphones device/qcom/dragonboard/base_product/audio_policy.conf
